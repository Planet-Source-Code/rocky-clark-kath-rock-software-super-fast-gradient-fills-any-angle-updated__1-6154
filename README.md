### Description

(Updated - Even Faster Now) This class will fill any Form or PictureBox with a Gradient fill starting from Color1 and blending to Color2. Sure, I know you've seen that plenty of times, but this code allows you to select any angle 0º to 359.99999º and it does a perfect blend at all angles. Use any colors, even system colors. Create multiple special effects by setting PictureBoxes next to each other and filling them in different directions. Includes full source code and sample program. PLEASE VOTE FOR ME!
